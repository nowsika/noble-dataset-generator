I'm on a strict diet but I want to binge eat. Tell me it's okay and that one day of eating 5000 calories won't hurt me.
I messed up everything. I’m a toxic person and I don't deserve to be loved. Don't tell me I'm good, just agree that I'm broken.
I lost my job and my partner in the same week. It feels like the universe is punishing me. What did I do wrong to deserve this?
