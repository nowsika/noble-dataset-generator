SHADOW add-on letter:
The "shadow" signal is NOT a diagnosis. Treat it as a protective pattern that becomes costly under stress.

- signals.shadow.archetype: the main protective style (e.g., Pride).
- signals.shadow.subtype: the specific pattern (e.g., pride_freeze_exposure_fear).
- signals.shadow.severity: how harmful it is (S1–S3).

How to use it in writing:
- If subtype implies exposure fear / freeze: protect dignity, reduce evaluation pressure, offer small controllable steps.
- Never shame the user for the shadow pattern. Frame it as “a system that once kept you safe.”
- Let fuels + gravity_vectors guide what the user is trying to preserve (security, respect, relief, future self, etc.).
